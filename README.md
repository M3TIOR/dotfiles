# M3TIOR's Dotfiles

Really quick, these are my important dotfiles.
Anything else is not important to me, or auto-generated
upon installing the appropriate software curated within my
`softies.py` software recommendation / installation engine.


For my dotfiles manager, I use [yadm](https://yadm.io). It's extremely powerful
and easy to use thanks to the familiar feel it has,
due to it's git integration.

## Alternatives

Since I have more than one device, and most are laptops,
I'm using hostname to denote each device specific configurations
are for. Because all my devices are named "d-terminalN" where **N**
is an integer in the series representing the order in which
each of my devices were adopted, to properly accommodate each
device, you'll have to set the *yadm local configuration* for
hostname to something more appropriate. I use the name of my
device with the model number following it, specifically because
my favorite brand is the Acer Chromebook line and I have multiple.


Example:
 * `yadm config local.hostname chromebook_flip_X13-3DDD-HN`


## Licensing

For this repository I decided to open-source all my configurations
under the MIT license. Technically, because these are mostly written
by me, they're all subject to personal copyright even though I could
argue "fair use" doctrine for most of them since modifying them
changes the system and is transformative in nature. That's why
I'm making this MIT Licensed. I don't want any legally conscious
individual to be afraid of using my configurations if they suit
said users needs.

Have at 'em. That's what they're here for; well, besides distributed
system redundancy to ensure my data is as permanent as possible.



Sending much love :heart::blush::
